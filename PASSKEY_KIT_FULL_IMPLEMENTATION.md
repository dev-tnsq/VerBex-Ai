# Passkey Kit Full Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of Passkey Kit smart contract wallets in the Verbex AI MCP server, using the official `passkey-kit` library for secure DeFi transactions without exposing private keys.

## Architecture

### Passkey Kit Integration

The implementation uses the official `passkey-kit` library:

```typescript
import { PasskeyKit, PasskeyServer } from 'passkey-kit';

export const wallet = new PasskeyKit({
  rpcUrl: 'https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org',
  networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET,
  walletWasmHash: 'ecd990f0b45ca6817149b6175f79b32efb442f35731985a084131e8265c4cd90',
});

export const server = new PasskeyServer({
  launchtubeUrl: 'https://testnet.launchtube.xyz',
  launchtubeJwt: 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...',
});
```

### Security Model

```
User → WebAuthn Biometric → Passkey Kit Smart Contract → Stellar Network
```

1. **Biometric Authentication**: User authenticates with Face ID/Touch ID/fingerprint
2. **Passkey Kit Verification**: Smart contract verifies the WebAuthn signature
3. **Transaction Signing**: Smart contract signs the transaction on-chain
4. **Network Submission**: Signed transaction is submitted to Stellar network

## Implementation Details

### PasskeyKitWallet Class

```typescript
class PasskeyKitWallet {
  private userAddress: string;
  private credentialId: string;
  private publicKey: string;
  private contractId?: string;
  private passkeyClient?: any;

  async deploySmartWallet(): Promise<string>
  async signTransaction(xdr: string): Promise<string>
  getContractId(): string | undefined
  getPasskeyClient(): any
}
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

When a user enrolls a passkey:

1. **WebAuthn Registration**: User creates a WebAuthn credential
2. **Passkey Kit Deployment**: A Soroban smart contract is deployed using Passkey Kit
3. **Public Key Storage**: The WebAuthn public key is stored in the contract
4. **Wallet Linking**: The smart contract is linked to the user's wallet address

### Transaction Signing Flow

1. **Transaction Creation**: MCP creates unsigned XDR transaction
2. **Biometric Challenge**: User is prompted for biometric authentication
3. **WebAuthn Assertion**: User provides biometric authentication
4. **Passkey Kit Verification**: Smart contract verifies the assertion
5. **Transaction Signing**: Smart contract signs the transaction
6. **Network Submission**: Signed transaction is submitted to Stellar

## MCP Tools

### Transaction Tools

All existing transaction tools (lend, borrow, swap, etc.) automatically use the Passkey Kit system when:

1. No `privateKey` is provided
2. No `AGENT_SECRET` environment variable is set
3. User has enrolled a Passkey Kit smart wallet

#### Example Transaction Flow

```json
{
  "status": "NEEDS_SIGNATURE",
  "unsignedXDR": "AAAAA...",
  "signingUrl": "http://localhost:3000/passkey/sign?walletAddress=GABC...&xdr=AAAAA...",
  "message": "Please visit the signing URL to authenticate with your Passkey Kit smart wallet and complete the transaction.",
  "instructions": [
    "1. Open the signing URL in your browser",
    "2. The transaction will be automatically signed using your Passkey Kit smart wallet",
    "3. Authenticate with your biometric (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint)",
    "4. The transaction will be signed by your smart contract and submitted to Stellar network"
  ]
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Passkey Kit Configuration

```typescript
// Passkey Kit Configuration
const launchtubeUrl = 'https://testnet.launchtube.xyz';
const launchtubeJwt = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...';

export const wallet = new PasskeyKit({
  rpcUrl: 'https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org',
  networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET,
  walletWasmHash: 'ecd990f0b45ca6817149b6175f79b32efb442f35731985a084131e8265c4cd90',
});

export const server = new PasskeyServer({
  launchtubeUrl,
  launchtubeJwt,
});
```

### Smart Contract Integration

The implementation includes a framework for Soroban smart contract integration:

```rust
// Soroban smart contract for Passkey Kit wallet
pub struct PasskeyWallet {
    pub owner: Address,
    pub credential_id: Bytes,
    pub public_key: Bytes,
}

impl PasskeyWallet {
    pub fn verify_signature(&self, signature: Bytes, challenge: Bytes) -> bool;
    pub fn sign_transaction(&self, transaction: Bytes) -> Bytes;
}
```

### WebAuthn Integration

Enhanced WebAuthn integration with proper credential management:

```typescript
// WebAuthn credential creation
const credential = await navigator.credentials.create({
  publicKey: {
    challenge: new Uint8Array(challenge),
    rp: { name: "VerbexAI DeFi", id: "localhost" },
    user: { id: new TextEncoder().encode(userAddress) },
    pubKeyCredParams: [{ alg: -7, type: "public-key" }],
    authenticatorSelection: {
      authenticatorAttachment: "platform",
      userVerification: "required",
    },
  },
});
```

## Security Features

### Challenge-Response Authentication
- Cryptographically secure random challenges
- Time-bounded (5 minute expiry)
- Single-use (deleted after verification)

### Smart Contract Security
- Public key stored on-chain in smart wallet
- Credential ID stored in MCP for verification
- No private keys stored anywhere

### Transaction Security
- Each transaction requires fresh passkey signature
- XDR integrity verified before signing
- User must explicitly authorize each action

## User Journey

### 1. Enrollment (One-time setup)
```
Cursor/Claude: > call enrollPasskey
MCP: Returns enrollment URL and instructions
User: Opens URL in browser, completes WebAuthn setup
Frontend: Deploys Passkey Kit smart contract, stores passkey
MCP: Confirms enrollment, smart wallet ready
```

### 2. Transaction Signing (Every transaction)
```
Cursor/Claude: > call lend { userAddress: "GABC...", amount: 100, asset: "XLM", poolId: "..." }
MCP: Returns signing URL with unsigned XDR
User: Opens URL in browser, authenticates with biometrics
Frontend: Passkey Kit smart contract signs transaction, submits to network
MCP: Returns transaction hash and confirmation
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **No Seed Phrases**: No need to manage private keys or seed phrases
- **Biometric Security**: Secure authentication with Face ID/Touch ID/fingerprint
- **Cross-Device**: Works across devices with WebAuthn sync
- **User-Friendly**: Simple, intuitive transaction signing

### For Developers
- **Headless Environment**: Works in MCP without wallet access
